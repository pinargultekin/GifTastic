## Abstract

On the left-hand side, there are eight buttons which are referred by a mood. 
When a user clicks any mood button, related gifs line up.
Gifs appear in "still" state once a user clicks it on, its state changes to animate.
On the right-hand side, there is a submit button to add a new mood button.
Once a new button is created, the user can click the created button, and it behaves just like the other existed buttons.
